    Chocolate tastes amazing, this is a fact. But have you ever wondered what
    is chocolate and where it comes from? What is the history of chocolate?
    How do we get different types of chocolate? Can chocolate be healthy, does
    it have chocolate benefits? 
      
      The mind boggles! With so many different
      varieties of chocolate and so many different things we can do with it as
      an ingredient, not only in food but in our day-to-day lives, we want to
      discuss all these interesting topics so that we can all benefit from the
      amazingness of chocolate.
